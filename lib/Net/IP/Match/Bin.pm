=head1 NAME

Net::IP::Match::Bin - Perl extension for match IP addresses against Net ranges

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::IP::Match::Bin;

  my $ipm = Net::IP::Match::Bin->new();
  $ipm->add("10.1.1.0/25", ...);
  ...
  $ipm->add("192.168.2.128/26", ...);

  $cidr = $ipm->match_ip("192.168.2.131");


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is XS implementation of matching IP addresses against Net ranges.
Using similar method to Net::IP::Match::Regexp in storing Net ranges into
memory. By implementing in XS C-code, and does not use regexp, more fast setup
time and less using memory.
This module is useful when Net ranges change often or reusing range data
won't be suitable.


=head1 METHODS

=over

=cut

=item new()

Create IP range object and initialize it.


=item $ipm->add( $net | $arrayref | $hashref, ... )

Add Network address (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/mask) into the object. mask is 1 .. 32 CIDR mask bit value.

    $ipm->add( [ "10.1.0.0/16", "10.2.2.128/25", "192.168.0.0/27" ] );

    $ipm->add( { "10.1.0.0/17" => "Net A", "10.2.2.0/24" => "Net B",
		"192.168.0.0/27" => "Net X" } );

When HASH ref is used as arguments, match_ip() returns the value when matched. Note that
CIDRs could be aggregated internaly, these values may be lost in aggregation.


=item $ipm->add_range( $range_str, ... )

Adds IP range into the object. $range_str would be

    $range_str = "1.2.3.4-10.20.30.41";

=item $cidr = $ipm->match_ip( $ip )

Searches matching $ip against previously setup networks. Returns matched
Network in CIDR format (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/mask). or undef unless matched.

=item $list = $ipm->list()

=item @list = $ipm->list()

Lists the current CIDR list which has been added previously. CIDRs are aggregated internaly and
the list shows this internal data. In scalar context, list() returns reference to the array. On
list context, returns array itself.

=item $ipm->clean()

Remove redundant CIDR data from the object. Note that this method does not free memories, so,
if you would like to, generate list() and create new object from it.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=cut

=item match_ip($ip, $cidr1, $cidr2,...)

function call match_ip() acts like as Net::IP::Match 's same name function. searches IP of first
argument matches againsts others.
